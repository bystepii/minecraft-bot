# Minecraft Bot

Different types of bots have been designed, each with different behaviors that can be modified through environment variables. Likewise, different strategies have been defined to determine how the bots connect to the server. The behavior of these strategies can also be adjusted using environment variables.

## Types of bots

### Simple-walk Bot

This bot moves randomly within a box.

### Miner Bot

This bot moves randomly within a box, just like the simple-walk bot. Additionally, at regular intervals, the bot places a block and then immediately destroys it. This behavior is repeated over time. 

### PVP Bot

This bot moves randomly within a box, just like the simple-walk bot. Additionally, when another bot is within 8 blocks or less, it will start attacking the other bot for a set amount of time. Once the attack time is over, there will be a cooldown period during which the bot continues moving randomly until the cooldown ends and it encounters another nearby bot.

## Spawn Strategies

### Interval Strategy (default)

Bots connect one by one in an orderly manner. After one bot connects, there is a waiting interval before the next one connects.

### Batch Strategy

Bots connect in batches. All bots in a batch connect simultaneously in parallel. Once a batch has connected, there is a waiting interval before launching the next batch of bots to connect.

> If the bot batch is larger than 10, it will be split into smaller batches, since connecting more than 10 bots at once may cause a server error. For example, if a batch of 15 bots is desired with a 40-second interval, it will be split into two batchesâ€”one of 10 and another of 5. The first batch will be launched, and once those bots have connected, the remaining bots will be launched. After this group has connected, the system will wait the 40-second interval before launching the next batch.

### Burst Strategy

All bots connect to the server at once in parallel. There are no delays between one connection and the next.

> The number of bots that can be launched in parallel to the server is limited to 10, as a higher number of simultaneous connections may cause a server error. If the number of bots to be launched exceeds this limit, they will be split into batches of up to 10 bots each. Bots will connect once the bots from the previous batch have successfully connected.

## Environment Variables

### Bot Connection

- ```BOT_HOST``` - Minecraft server address the bots should connect to
- ```BOT_PORT``` - Port to connect to the Minecraft server

### Workers

- ```WORKER_TO_RUN``` - Type of bot to run [simple-walk|miner|pvp]
- ```BOT_COUNT``` - Number of bots to spawn

### Bounding Box

- ```BOX_WIDTH``` - Width of the bounding box the bot will move within
- ```BOX_CENTER_X``` - X coordinate of the bounding box center
- ```BOX_CENTER_Z``` - Z coordinate of the bounding box center

### Metrics

- ```PROMETHEUS_PORT```
- ```RESPONSE_METRIC``` - [true|false] enable or disable the latency metric (bots will or will not send messages in the chat)
- ```RESPONSE_INTERVAL``` - Time interval that must pass between sending one chat message and the next
- ```RESPONSE_BOT_COUNT``` - Number of bots (from the total) that will send a message to the game chat (only if the response metric is enabled)

### Spawn Behavior

- ```SPAWN_STRATEGY``` - Spawn strategy to follow for connecting bots to the server [interval|burst|batch]
- ```SPAWN_BATCH_SIZE``` - ***(batch strategy)*** number of bots in the batch
- ```SPAWN_BATCH_DELAY``` - ***(batch strategy)*** time interval between the connection of one batch of bots and the next
- ```BOT_SPAWN_INTERVAL``` - ***(interval strategy)*** waiting time interval between the connection of one bot and the next
- ```BOT_COUNT_INTERVAL``` - How often the bots' connection to the server should be checked (to verify if all are still connected)

### Bot Behavior

- ```WALK_UPDATE_INTERVAL``` - ***(simple-walk bot)*** how often the bot should check its position to move toward the assigned point
- ```PLACE_BLOCK_INTERVAL``` - ***(miner bot)*** time interval between placing one block and the next
- ```ATTACK_INTERVAL``` - ***(pvp bot)*** duration the bot should continuously attack
- ```ATTACK_COOLDOWN``` - ***(pvp bot)*** time that must pass between the end of one attack round and the start of the next
